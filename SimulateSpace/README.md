# Solar-System
Began as final project in computational physics class. Continued to work on independently

## Objectives
1. Run short simulations of 165 years for the 9 body model to find optimal time step 
2. Produce two dimensional animation of the 9 body solar system obits for an extended period of time.
3. Validate orbital periods of the planets in our system with the available data from JPL.
4. Produce two dimensional plots of the 19 body system (now including the ten most massive asteroids) for an extended period of time (10,000 years). 
5. Validate orbital periods of asteroids with the available data from JPL.
6. Produce plots of energy and angular momentum conservation via relative error plots of the conserved energy and angular momentum of the system. Utilize relative error plots
7. Potentially visualize plotting in VPython.
