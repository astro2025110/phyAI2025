# Project 1: To Brake Or Not To Brake

For this project I investigated the decisions that a driver can make when braking
for a traffic light that switches from green to yellow by writing code
in Python to model the car's behavior for different decisions and
parameters. I also wrote a short report to communicate, discuss and
summarize your reasoning and your results.

## Instructions

1. Please use my Juypter notebook as the primary refence
for my code. It contains all of the code used in the project.

2. profile.py can only be used for plotting the position and 
velocity time series.

3. All code should be run in Jupyter 

4. Before running code, run all the imports included within
the file. Also, run every function

5. Before testing functions, ensure that parameters are defined
as shown in profile.py

6. When making calculations over a range of x0, utilize a loop
as shown in Report.ipynb under section 3.2. Same for v0.
