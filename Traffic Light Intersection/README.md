# Project 1: To Brake Or Not To Brake
[![Autograding Workflow](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml) ![Points badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/points.svg)

You will investigate the decisions that a driver can make when braking
for a traffic light that switches from green to yellow by writing code
in Python to model the car's behavior for different decisions and
parameters. You will write a short report to communicate, discuss and
summarize your reasoning and your results.

## Submission

Submit your

* report
* code
* `README.txt`

in your private Project 1 repository in the `Submission` directory.

You may combine report and code in a Jupyter notebook (with additional
code separately if necessary) or submit the report as a PDF and code
separately.

**Your code must run and produce the figures and results in your
report.** Include a file `README.txt` that **describes how to run your
code**. For a notebook this should be "Run Kernel -> Restart &
Run". For code in a file this might be "Run `python project_1.py`."
Include all information that is necessary to run your code and
reproduce your results.


## Repository structure

Your repository contains

* [project_1.pdf](project_1.pdf): project specification
* `Submission` directory: submit your code and report in this
  directory; *only content in `Submission` will be graded*
* `Work` directory: you can use this directory for testing or
  alternative solutions. Instructors will ignore it for grading.
* `Grade`: Instructors will submit a grade and evaluation in this
  directory. (Your grade will also be posted in the Grade book on
  Canvas.)
  
## Tests

There are *no grading tests*. The provided tests only check that
certain files are included.
