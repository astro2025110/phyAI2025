This document contains instructions for running my code that I submitted in my report.

1. Please use my Juypter notebook as the primary refence
for my code. It contains all of the code used in the project.

2. profile.py can only be used for plotting the position and 
velocity time series.

3. All code should be run in Jupyter 

4. Before running code, run all the imports included within
the file. Also, run every function

5. Before testing functions, ensure that parameters are defined
as shown in profile.py

6. When making calculations over a range of x0, utilize a loop
as shown in Report.ipynb under section 3.2. Same for v0.
