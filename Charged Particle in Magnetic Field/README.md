# Project 2: Magnetic lens in the SEM (SOLUTION)
[![GitHub Classroom Workflow](../../workflows/GitHub%20Classroom%20Workflow/badge.svg?branch=main)](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml) ![Points badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/points.svg)

You will investigate a key component in a modern scanning electron
microscope: the magnetic lens. You will write a short report to
communicate, discuss and summarize your reasoning and your
results. This is a *team project*.

## Submission

Submit your 

* report
* code
* `README.txt`

in your private Project 2 repository in the `Submission` directory.

You may combine report and code in a Jupyter notebook (with additional
code separately if necessary) or submit the report as a PDF and code
separately.

**Your code must run and produce the figures and results in your
report.** Include a file `README.txt` that **describes how to run your
code**. For a notebook this should be "Run Kernel -> Restart &
Run". For code in a file this might be "Run `python project_1.py`."
Include all information that is necessary to run your code and
reproduce your results.


## Repository structure

Your repository contains

* [project_2.pdf](project_2.pdf): project specification
* `Submission` directory: submit your code and report in this
  directory; *only content in `Submission` will be graded*
* `Work` directory: you can use this directory for testing or
  alternative solutions. Instructors will ignore it for grading.
* `Grade`: Instructors will submit a grade and evaluation in this
  directory. (Your grade will also be posted in the Grade book on Canvas.)


## Tests

There are *no grading tests*. The provided tests only check that
certain files are included.
